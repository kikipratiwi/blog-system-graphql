# Design Theme
This site has a **clean and minimalist** design that hopes can empower site’s ability to _do more with less_. I getting rid of any excessive and, therefore, unnecessary components and features. By removing anything that isn’t necessary to the page’s goal, I ensure that users have a less stressful and more engaging experience. 

The emphasis for this site is on **simple colors** and design choices that promote functionality and a sense of calm. I use full-color backgrounds to energize empty space. I also have an eye for **typography**, however, the use of typography becomes even more influential, because there are fewer elements on a page. 

Since it **"just"** a simple blog system that displays plain text articles without any categorized, I made it an _easy-to-use_ design. Without any **meticulous navigation**, user just needs to scroll down the screen to find their suit articles. Each articles is displayed along with its initial few sentences that hopes can increase the desire of users to read the article, in further development this feature can be used to display the leading sentence of the article.

**Most of these sites inspiration comes from [Sosio Design](https://www.behance.net/SocioDesign).
